<font color="magenta"><h3>Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles that are controlled either remotely or autonomously and are used for hundreds of missions where the small, inconspicuous size is a plus. Drone in English means drone, loafer. This is also the name of unmanned aerial vehicles. They are driven by remote control or on a pre-set route with the help of GPS - the device can be programmed for self-execution. A drone has one or more fins, the variety of sizes is even greater - it fits in the palm of your hand or is as big as a car. What unites everyone is that they have many applications.</h3></font>

<h3>Drones today are smarter and more stable than ever. But most are not designed to maneuver in tight spaces or around living things. This is not the case with Gimbol, which is for such needs. It was constructed by Flyability, a team from Switzerland - as the rotating cage around its body protects it from breaking when it encounters walls or other obstacles. Gimbol is also very light and would not harm a person even when touched. It can penetrate tunnels or collapsed buildings. It is so impressive that it won its authors a million dollars in grants from the United Arab Emirates. This happened at the race in Dubai, where 39 drones took part, but Gimbol was the winner. The team that created it will continue to develop variations of it - drones are the search and rescue.

<h3>This is not a new drone-toy to fill the shelves of super gadget stores. This is a drone capable of incredible feats in cinema, thanks to all kinds of high-tech extras, packed in a shiny black shell, as is its appearance. Not only that - the "Solo" is the first aircraft that offers full control of the settings of the GoPro camera during each flight. This saves you from having to land it every time you want to change settings. There's also a selfie mode called "dramatic", which starts with close-up photos of your face and moves away slightly, capturing your action-like actions.

They have such functions that they become truly autonomous devices that can make their own decisions.<br>
